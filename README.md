# Domain4k

Domain4k is a micro framework that helps write Domain Driven Design (DDD) applications in Kotlin.
More specifically, it provides a set of tiny and independent abstractions that you can cherry-pick in your application.


# TODO
- More doc: core principles, list of abstractions, etc..
- Showcase delete entity in sample domain
- Showcase more complex features in sample domain: cross entity interaction, etc..
- Better logging context
- WithEvents / Eq / Entity code generation
- Error Handling utils with Arrow Either
- Refine events context functions: maybe delete them?
